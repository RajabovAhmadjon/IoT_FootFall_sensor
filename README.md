# IoT_FootFall_sensor
This project is to implement the footfall sensor using ESP8266 Aston IoT hardware platform which can transfer the results over MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) which is a publish/subscribe protocol and over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) as the board is connected to the WiFi network. The number of footfalls can be reset remotely by using MQTT and HTTPS.
